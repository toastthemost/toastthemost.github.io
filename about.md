The Toastmasters Interactive Toolkit is a web-based application created to enhance and simplify the conduct of Toastmasters meetings. It provides essential tools including timekeeping, filler word tracking, and speaker queue management, all integrated into a single, user-friendly platform. This application has been developed by the “Toast the Most FIL Club A” Toastmasters club at Fidelity International, with the goal of supporting members in building communication and leadership skills efficiently during club sessions.
